# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 🖐️

Hey there, I'm Hugo – a front-end web and mobile developer with a strong focus on React (both JS and Native).

🔭 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of NFC Tags through a fascinating project – the NFC Manager. My goal is to unravel the secrets of NFC Tags and bolster their security by adding password protection. This breakthrough will pave the way for a secure tag certification system for genuine artworks. You can see this in action in our year-end project, [Vaulth](https://github.com/Vaulth).

🚀 I'm open to any insights or tips you might have about the `react-native-nfc-manager` package! Your expertise could be a game-changer – thank you in advance! 💳

🌐 My journey also led me to explore the realm of blockchain and decentralized applications (dapps). One of my key accomplishments was the creation of a React Native dapp, designed to connect seamlessly with MetaMask and WalletConnect. This innovative dapp facilitates actions like signing messages and transferring cryptocurrencies – providing users with secure and streamlined interactions within the blockchain ecosystem.

👇 My next endeavor? Taking this dapp a step further by integrating wallets with a wide array of features. From comprehensive user profiles and real-time balances to enabling the seamless transfer of NFTs and cryptocurrencies – I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this exciting space.
