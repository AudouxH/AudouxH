## Welcome on my Github profile 🖐️
#### I'm hugo, a front-end web and mobile developer focus on the framework React (JS and Native).

#### Currently on a NFC Manager project to understand how NFC Tags work and trying to put password security on it. This acheivement will able me to create a secure tag certification for real artworks. It will be implement on our years end project Vaulth (https://github.com/Vaulth). By the way if you have any tips about react-native-nfc-manager package i'll take everything, thanks per advance ! 💳

#### i'm also interest about web3 that i discovered thanks to Vaulth. I done a dapp connection with metamask and wallet connect than you can find bellow. 👇 <br/> Next step will be to integrate a wallet with as much as i can of features (profile, balance, transfer of nft or crypto monnaie).
