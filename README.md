## Welcome on my Github profile üñêÔ∏è
#### I'm hugo, a front-end web and mobile developer focus on the framework React (JS and Native).

#### Currently on a NFC Manager project to understand how NFC Tags work and trying to put password security on it. This acheivement will able me to create a secure tag certification for real artworks. It will be implement on our years end project Vaulth (https://github.com/Vaulth). By the way if you have any tips about react-native-nfc-manager package i'll take everything, thanks per advance ! üí≥

#### i'm also interest about web3 that i discovered thanks to Vaulth. I'm currently trying to integrate differents wallet connection into a react native dapp like @metamask/sdk or @walletconnect/web3modal. Thinking about what kind of project i can do, to learn smart contract development with a web front-end interface.
